?? Plan2Fund — User Journey MASTER (V11 Final Blueprint)

## 1. Global Rules
- Dynamic NavBar: starts from Funding (3a) or Plan (3b) depending on entry.
- Personas affect component behavior (Frustrated = defaults, Newbie = tooltips, Expert = advanced, Idea-Stage = educational bubbles).
- Inputs: at least 1 mandatory per block, 1 optional (defaults filled if skipped, flagged in Preview).
- Uploads: drag & drop per block, file list shown in Preview.
- State: auto-saved in local storage.
- Layout: Layout.jsx wraps all pages with NavBar + Footer.
- Animations: Hero float, fade-in sections, survey slide, stagger cards, tooltip slide, expand blocks.
- Responsiveness: NavBar collapses, grids stack, tables scroll.
